<p style="text-align: center;">
  A very sad song from &#8220;the Game of Thrones&#8221; in the red Wedding
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
</p>

  


<p style="text-align: center;">
  And who are you, the proud lord said,<br /> that I must bow so low?<br /> Only a cat of a different coat,<br /> That’s all the truth I know.<br /> In a coat of gold or a coat of red,<br /> A lion still has claws,<br /> And mine are long and sharp, my lord,<br /> As long and sharp as yours.<br /> And so he spoke, and so he spoke,<br /> That lord of Castamere,<br /> But now the rains weep o’er his hall,<br /> With no one there to hear.<br /> Yes now the rains weep o’er his hall,<br /> With not a soul to hear.<br /> And so he spoke, and so he spoke,<br /> That lord of Castamere,<br /> But now the rains weep o’er his hall,<br /> With no one there to hear.<br /> Yes now the rains weep o’er his hall,<br /> With not a soul to hear.
