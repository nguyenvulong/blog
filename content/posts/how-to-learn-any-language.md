This basic principle is applied for most of you but not all of you

To be fluent in any language needs a lot of practicing, in my humble opinion it can be divided into few steps like this  
&#8211; Understand basic vocabularies and the culture  
&#8211; Be able to communicate in simple sentences and listen to/ understand daily life communications<span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> &#8211; Understand most of conversations as well as be able to speak/response to native speakers without any hesitation (though there would be few minor grammar/spelling mistakes) in general topics</span>

<div class="text_exposed_show">
  <p>
    And finally &#8211; immerse in the community, be a part of that society &#8211; this one requires you to be living in the country where you can interact with native speakers and their culture so that you can truly understand what&#8217;s that language &#8220;feel&#8221; like.

    This kind of learning method imitates how the babies learn their mother tongues since the moment they were born.
