Nếu bạn làm việc gì as quick as a flash, có nghĩa là bạn làm việc đó nhanh như chớp, nhanh như cắt.

Ví dụ :

*John knew the answer so he put his hand up as quick as a flash.  
*The customers are complaining. We need to get more food on the shelves as quick as a flash.  
*That new train is so fast. We were in Paris as quick as a flash.
