Quick solution: WAIT (1-2 hours) and manually register the SIM with the Mobile Network (AT&T, Viettel, olleh, etc.) in **Settings** section.

I had this problem when traveling from Vietnam to Korea. My SIMs worked fine in Vietnam, I had 2 of them and both didn&#8217;t work when I brought them to Korea, 1 SIM was registered and 1 SIM was to replace the old one which I had been using for years (I wanted to upgrade this one to 4G/LTE compatible version).

Both showed the same erroneous message: &#8220;SIM not provisioned&#8221;. The phone Mobile Network also showed that the Mobile Networks in Korea (e.g. olleh) are &#8220;forbidden&#8221;. After doing some research on the Internet, I realized it is not hardware but software problem, and I might not be able to use both SIMs as I have to register them with the Mobile Networks here &#8211; which I&#8217;d give up.

Luckily after letting the SIM inside the phone for 1-2 hours, the VinaPhone SIM started to work. I am doing the same with the Viettel SIM now.  
So far this is the only solution that seems feasible to me, don&#8217;t mind trying to &#8220;fix&#8221; the SIM, it&#8217;s fine, give it some hours to be registered. In my case I had to manually register it with the network (in Settings section) after the wait.



Good luck.
