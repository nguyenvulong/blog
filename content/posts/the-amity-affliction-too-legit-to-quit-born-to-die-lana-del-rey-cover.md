  <br /> Feet don&#8217;t fail me now<br /> Take me to the finish line<br /> All my heart, it breaks every step that I take<br /> But I&#8217;m hoping that the gates,<br /> They&#8217;ll tell me that you&#8217;re mine<br /> Walking through the city streets<br /> Is it by mistake or design?<br /> I feel so alone on a Friday night<br /> Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you&#8217;re mine<br /> It&#8217;s like I told you honey<br /> Don&#8217;t make me sad, don&#8217;t make me cry<br /> Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough<br /> I don&#8217;t know why<br /> Keep making me laugh,<br /> Let&#8217;s go get high<br /> The road is long, we carry on<br /> Try to have fun in the meantime<br /> Come and take a walk on the wild side<br /> Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain<br /> You like your girls insane<br /> Choose your last words<br /> This is the last time<br /> Cause you and I, we were born to die<br /> Lost but now I am found<br /> I can see but once I was blind<br /> I was so confused as a little child<br /> Tried to take what I could get<br /> Scared that I couldn&#8217;t find<br /> All the answers, honey<br /> Don&#8217;t make me sad, don&#8217;t make me cry<br /> Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough<br /> I don&#8217;t know why<br /> Keep making me laugh,<br /> Let&#8217;s go get high<br /> The road is long, we carry on<br /> Try to have fun in the meantime<br /> Come and take a walk on the wild side<br /> Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain<br /> You like your girls insane<br /> Choose your last words,<br /> This is the last time<br /> Cause you and I<br /> We were born to die<br /> We were born to die<br /> We were born to die<br /> Come and take a walk on the wild side<br /> Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain<br /> You like your girls insane<br /> Don&#8217;t make me sad, don&#8217;t make me cry<br /> Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough<br /> I don&#8217;t know why<br /> Keep making me laugh,<br /> Let&#8217;s go get high<br /> The road is long, we carry on<br /> Try to have fun in the meantime<br /> Come and take a walk on the wild side<br /> Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain<br /> You like your girls insane<br /> Choose your last words<br /> This is the last time<br /> Cause You and I<br /> We were born to die<br /> We were born to die
