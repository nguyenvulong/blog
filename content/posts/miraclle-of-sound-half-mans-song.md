    <p>
      There are some who are born distinguished<br /> There are some who are raised in praise<br /> But me I was always the last in line<br /> A blot in my father&#8217;s gaze
    </p>
    
    <p>
      No cheekbones chiselled on a feline face<br /> No skill or savvy with a sword<br /> But this game we all play is won in wily ways<br /> And sly is this littlest lord
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Cruel tricks of romance<br /> Degraded by their spite<br /> You snub your cub too many times<br /> You just might feel his bite&#8230;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Beware beware of the words I twist<br /> I am small but my reach is long<br /> And the ravens black against the winter&#8217;s mist<br /> Are whispering the half-man&#8217;s song<br /> Whispering the half man&#8217;s song&#8230;

    The land is a blooming orchard<br /> With fruits so juicy and ripe<br /> With a clink of a coin loose the lion&#8217;s loin<br /> Play a tune on the half man&#8217;s pipe
  </div>
  
  <div class="column_text">
    In the arms of a whore I made a promise<br /> Sinking deeper into danger every day<br /> Cut through all their shit with a brazen wit<br /> Moulding puppets from their minds of clay
  </div>
  
  <div class="column_text">
  </div>
  
  <div class="column_text">
    I&#8217;m no man of honour<br /> Myself is my true king<br /> But somewhere deep within me<br /> The bells of conscience ring
  </div>
  
  <div class="column_text">
    Beware beware of the words I twist<br /> I am small but my reach is long<br /> And the ravens black against the winter&#8217;s mist<br /> Are whispering the half-man&#8217;s song<br /> They&#8217;re whispering the half man&#8217;s song&#8230;
