Can you speak English like this girl ?  
I just want to PROVE something for you :

1. You can learn to speak & listening BEFORE learning to write & reading English . Look at the child, see how he&#8217;s learned English when we was born.

2. Grammar is necessary BUT NOT obligatory, which means you don&#8217;t have to learn too much grammar to be an English Master. By speaking & listening, you&#8217;ve already done that .

3. Learning English is not too hard, I myself never learn English, I play with it ! Well, believe in yourself, and good luck .

If you find this useful, please SHARE it . Thank you !
