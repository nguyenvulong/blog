This is where I collect ideas and opinions that I am engaged with

&#8220;I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I&#8217;ve been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn&#8217;t have. Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I&#8217;m a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally I am an atheist. I don&#8217;t have the evidence to prove that God doesn&#8217;t exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn&#8217;t that I don&#8217;t want to waste my time.&#8221;  
**(Isaac Asimov on Science and the Bible (Free Inquiry&nbsp;– Spring 1982)**

“In fact, _atheism_ is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a &#8220;non-astrologer&#8221; or a &#8220;non-alchemist.&#8221; We do not have words for people who doubt that evils is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.”  
―&nbsp;**Sam Harris,&nbsp;**[Letter to a Christian Nation][1]

“Tell a devout Christian that his wife is cheating on him, or that frozen yogurt can make a man invisible, and he is likely to require as much evidence as anyone else, and to be persuaded only to the extent that you give it. Tell him that the book he keeps by his bed was written by an invisible deity who will punish him with fire for eternity if he fails to accept its every incredible claim about the universe, and he seems to require no evidence what so ever.”  
―&nbsp;**Sam Harris,&nbsp;**[The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason][2]

“Either God can do nothing to stop catastrophes like this, or he doesn&#8217;t care to, or he doesn’t exist. God is either impotent, evil, or imaginary. Take your pick, and choose wisely.

The only sense to make of tragedies like this is that terrible things can happen to perfectly innocent people. This understanding inspires compassion.

Religious faith, on the other hand, erodes compassion. Thoughts like, &#8216;this might be all part of God’s plan,&#8217; or &#8216;there are no accidents in life,&#8217; or &#8216;everyone on some level gets what he or she deserves&#8217; &#8211; these ideas are not only stupid, they are extraordinarily callous. They are nothing more than a childish refusal to connect with the suffering of other human beings. It is time to grow up and let our hearts break at moments like this.”  
―&nbsp;**Sam Harris**

“While believing strongly, without evidence, is considered a mark of madness or stupidity in any other area of our lives, faith in God still holds immense prestige in our society. Religion is the one area of our discourse where it is considered noble to pretend to be certain about things no human being could possibly be certain about. It is telling that this aura of nobility extends only to those faiths that still have many subscribers. Anyone caught worshipping Poseidon, even at sea, will be thought insane.”  
― **Sam Harris, **[Letter to a Christian Nation][1]
