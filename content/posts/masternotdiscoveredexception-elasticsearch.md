Sometimes, when you want to join a node toÂ  elasticsearch cluster, this problem may occur (the reason may vary, but I think there are some limitations of using multicast here)

**Solution: **  
Uncomment those lines in **elasticsearch.yml**

We tell this host (node) to use unicast discovery instead of multicast, and then specify the master host manually for this node.
