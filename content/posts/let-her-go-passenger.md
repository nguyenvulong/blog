  Well you only need the light when it&#8217;s burning low<br /> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br /> Only know your lover when you let her go<br /> Only know you&#8217;ve been high when you&#8217;re feeling low<br /> Only hate the road when you&#8217;re missin&#8217; home<br /> Only know your lover when you&#8217;ve let her go<br /> And you let her go<br /> Staring at the bottom of your glass<br /> Hoping one day you will make a dream last<br /> The dreams come slow and it goes so fast<br /> You see her when you close your eyes<br /> Maybe one day you will understand why<br /> Everything you touch all it dies<br /> But you only need the light when it&#8217;s burning low<br /> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br /> Only know your lover when you&#8217;ve let her go<br /> Only know you&#8217;ve been high when you&#8217;re feeling low<br /> Only hate the road when you&#8217;re missin&#8217; home<br /> Only know your lover when you&#8217;ve let her go<br /> Staring at the ceiling in the dark<br /> Same all empty feeling in your heart<br /> Love comes slow and it goes so fast<br /> Well you see her when you fall asleep<br /> But never to touch and never to keep<br /> Because you loved her to much<br /> And you dive too deep<br /> Well you only need the light when it&#8217;s burning low<br /> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br /> Only know your lover when you&#8217;ve let her go<br /> Only know you&#8217;ve been high when you&#8217;re feeling low<br /> Only hate the road when you&#8217;re missin&#8217; home<br /> Only know your lover when you&#8217;ve let her go<br /> And you let her go<br /> Ooooo ooooo oooooo<br /> And you let her go<br /> Ooooooo ooooo ooooo<br /> You let her go<br /> Because you only need the light when it&#8217;s burning low<br /> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br /> Only know your lover when you&#8217;ve let her go<br /> Only know you&#8217;ve been high when you&#8217;re feeling low<br /> Only hate the road when you&#8217;re missin&#8217; home<br /> Only know your lover when you&#8217;ve let her go<br /> Because you only need the light when it&#8217;s burning low<br /> Only miss the sun when it starts to snow<br /> Only know your lover when you&#8217;ve let her go<br /> Only know you&#8217;ve been high when you&#8217;re feeling low<br /> Only hate the road when you&#8217;re missin&#8217; home<br /> Only know your lover when you&#8217;ve let her go<br /> And you let her go
