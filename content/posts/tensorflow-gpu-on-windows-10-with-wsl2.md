Download miniconda from [here][2] (make sure to use Linux Installer)

Follow this tutorial for installing nvidia container for wsl2 https: //ubuntu.com/blog/getting-started-with-cuda-on-ubuntu-on-wsl-2

If you have issue with the tutorial above, read this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https: //github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL/issues/457" target="_blank">dockerd</a>, that tutorial above is not complete as the docker daemon was not be able to run.
