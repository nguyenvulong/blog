  <br /> Heart beats fast<br /> Colors and promises<br /> How to be brave<br /> How can I love when I&#8217;m afraid to fall<br /> But watching you stand alone<br /> All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow<br /> One step closer<br /> [Chorus: ]<br /> I have died everyday waiting for you<br /> Darling don&#8217;t be afraid I have loved you<br /> For a thousand years<br /> I&#8217;ll love you for a thousand more
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Time stands still<br /> Beauty in all she is<br /> I will be brave<br /> I will not let anything take away<br /> What&#8217;s standing in front of me<br /> Every breath<br /> Every hour has come to this
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  One step closer
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  [Chorus: ]<br /> I have died everyday waiting for you<br /> Darling don&#8217;t be afraid I have loved you<br /> For a thousand years<br /> I&#8217;ll love you for a thousand more
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  And all along I believed I would find you<br /> Time has brought your heart to me<br /> I have loved you for a thousand years<br /> I&#8217;ll love you for a thousand more
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  One step closer<br /> One step closer
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  [Chorus: ]<br /> I have died everyday waiting for you<br /> Darling don&#8217;t be afraid I have loved you<br /> For a thousand years<br /> I&#8217;ll love you for a thousand more
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  And all along I believed I would find you<br /> Time has brought your heart to me<br /> I have loved you for a thousand years<br /> I&#8217;ll love you for a thousand more
</p>
