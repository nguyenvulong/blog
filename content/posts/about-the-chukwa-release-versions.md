I&#8217;m working with some log collection & aggregation tools from Apache Project, when  it came to Chukwa &#8211; I read the introduction, release note of the project and didn&#8217;t know what to do because it seemed like Chukwa had been in and out for a while and a bit obsolete. So I decided to email the leader of this project.

To be honest, I&#8217;ve tried to search on the net for all information about this project but got a little of it.

To summarize :

&#8211; Chukwa 0.5.0 incubator &#8211; the most current one will work with Hadoop 1.2.1

So everyone like me who want to test it on Hadoop 2.2.0 will wait for some time.
